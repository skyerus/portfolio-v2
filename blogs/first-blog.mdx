# Welcome to My Blog

This is my **first** blog post using *markdown*. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Features

Here are some features of this blog:

- Written in MDX
- Styled with Mantine
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks

### Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```typescript
function greeting(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

### Next Steps

I plan to write more blog posts about:
1. Web Development
2. UI/UX Design
3. Software Architecture
4. Best Practices

Stay tuned for more content!
